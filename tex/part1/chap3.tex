\section{Introduction}
Nitrogen dioxide (NO\textsubscript{2}) is a key air pollutant that can have harmful effects on human health. An increase in nitrogen oxide (NOx = NO + NO2) concentrations contributes to global warming through a chemical reaction that leads to the formation of ozone (O3), a short- lived climate pollutant with a potent warming effect \citep{ipcc2013}. The lifetime of NO2 is strongly influenced by photochemical reactions and meteorological parameters
